Yan is currently a research assistant at York University in econometrics. 

She started her professional career in London as a data scientist for Barclays then moved to Nairobi as a corporate and investment banker where she developed a deep passion for art and social entrepreneurship from both geographies. 

After over 5 years in banking, she took a career break to pursue sculpting at National Taiwan University of Arts in Taipei for 5 months. 

She moved back to Hong Kong for her family. She started a not-for-profit organization, Art Around !, to promote mental and physical health through yoga, art and mindfulness classes and events. Yan is the founder and teacher in yoga, art and mindfulness.

For over 2 years in Hong Kong, she has been part of the founding team to build and steer a fast-growing and pioneering charity/ family office supporting scientific research and deep-tech startups, facilitating technology transfer as well as promoting public education in technology. 

From her international experience in finance in developing countries and charities, she finds the tremendous missing link between social needs, technology transfer, public policy and effective program design fascinating and exciting. 

Equipped with quantitative and qualitative tools from her Economics training, she strives to drive the public policy or commercial mandates in public or private sector so organizations are more comfortable to take on unconventional but sustainable and impactful projects in challenging industries or regions.

Yan received 2 full scholarships for her undergraduate and graduate degrees in Economics.
